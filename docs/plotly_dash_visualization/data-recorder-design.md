3. **Usability**
   - One-click recording start/stop
   - Clear visual feedback for recording state
   - Easy access to recorded files

## System Architecture

### Data Flow and Threading Model

**Critical Design Principle**: Data collection must NEVER be blocked by recording operations.

```
[XIAO Device] --BLE--> [Data Collection Thread] --> [DataBuffer] --> [UI Thread]
                            (Highest Priority)           ↓
                                              [Index-based Access API]
                                                        ↓
                                             [Recording Worker Thread]
                                                        ↓
                                               [RecordFileWriter]
                                               (Sync I/O + Buffering)
```

### Threading Architecture

1. **Data Collection Thread** (Existing - Highest Priority)
   - Receives BLE data from XIAO device
   - Writes directly to DataBuffer with lock-free append
   - **MUST NEVER BE BLOCKED** by recording operations
   - Real-time operation at ~25Hz

2. **UI Update Thread** (Existing - Medium Priority)
   - Reads from DataBuffer for visualization
   - Updates Plotly graphs at 15 FPS
   - Non-blocking buffer access

3. **Recording Worker Thread** (New - Low Priority)
   - Dedicated thread for file writing operations
   - Uses synchronous I/O with internal buffering
   - Communicates via thread-safe queue (no additional event loops)
   - Timer-based polling every 10-20ms for new data

### Core Components

#### 1. RecorderManager Class

Central coordinator for recording operations (simplified from design review):

```python
class RecorderManager:
    def __init__(self, buffer: DataBuffer, output_dir: Path):
        self._buffer = buffer
        self._output_dir = output_dir
        self._worker_thread: Optional[RecordingWorkerThread] = None
        self._is_recording = False

    def start_recording(self, prefix: Optional[str] = None,
                       duration: Optional[float] = None) -> SessionInfo
    def stop_recording(self) -> SessionInfo
    def get_status(self) -> RecordingStatus
```

#### 2. RecordingWorkerThread Class

Dedicated thread for file writing operations:

```python
class RecordingWorkerThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, buffer: DataBuffer, file_writer: RecordFileWriter):
        super().__init__(daemon=True)
        self._buffer = buffer
        self._writer = file_writer
        self._last_read_index = 0
        self._stop_event = threading.Event()

    def run(self) -> None:
        """Main worker loop with timer-based polling"""
        while not self._stop_event.is_set():
            new_samples, next_index, dropped = self._buffer.get_since_index(
                self._last_read_index
            )

            if dropped:
                logger.warning("Data loss detected during recording")

            if new_samples:
                self._writer.append_rows(new_samples)
                self._last_read_index = next_index

            # Timer-based polling every 10-20ms
            self._stop_event.wait(0.02)  # 50Hz polling rate
```

#### 3. RecordFileWriter Class

Handles synchronous file operations with internal buffering (unified naming):

```python
class RecordFileWriter:
    def __init__(self, filepath: Path, buffer_size: int = 100):
        self._filepath = filepath
        self._buffer_size = buffer_size  # Flush every N rows
        self._write_buffer: List[str] = []
        self._file_handle: Optional[TextIO] = None
        self._sample_count = 0

    def append_rows(self, samples: List[ImuRow]) -> None:
        """Add samples to write buffer"""
        csv_lines = [self._format_csv_row(sample) for sample in samples]
        self._write_buffer.extend(csv_lines)
        self._sample_count += len(samples)

        # Flush when buffer is full (every ~4 seconds at 25Hz)
        if len(self._write_buffer) >= self._buffer_size:
            self.flush()

    def flush(self, force_fsync: bool = False) -> None:
        """Write buffered data to disk"""
        if not self._write_buffer or not self._file_handle:
            return

        # Synchronous write (simple and reliable)
        self._file_handle.writelines(self._write_buffer)
        self._write_buffer.clear()

        if force_fsync:
            self._file_handle.flush()
            os.fsync(self._file_handle.fileno())

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Close file and write metadata"""
        if self._file_handle:
            self.flush(force_fsync=True)
            self._file_handle.close()
            self._write_metadata_file()
```

#### 4. Enhanced DataBuffer API

Index-based access for efficient recording monitoring:

```python
class DataBuffer:
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 1000):
        self._buffer: deque[ImuRow] = deque(maxlen=max_size)
        self._lock = threading.RLock()
        self._write_index = 0  # Monotonic counter
        self._base_index = 0   # Index of first element in buffer

    def get_since_index(self, last_index: int) -> tuple[list[ImuRow], int, bool]:
        """
        Get samples since last_index with drop detection.

        Returns:
            - samples: List of new samples
            - next_index: Index to use for next call
            - dropped: True if data was lost due to buffer overflow
        """
        with self._lock:
            # Detect if requested data was dropped
            dropped = last_index < self._base_index

            if dropped:
                # Return all available data and warn about loss
                return list(self._buffer), self._write_index, True

            # Calculate slice indices
            start_offset = max(0, last_index - self._base_index)
            end_offset = self._write_index - self._base_index

            if start_offset >= len(self._buffer):
                return [], self._write_index, False

            # Return slice of buffer
            samples = list(self._buffer)[start_offset:end_offset]
            return samples, self._write_index, False
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Format Specification

#### CSV Header Format

```csv
# XIAO nRF52840 Sense Recording Session
# Start Time: 2024-08-24T16:30:00+09:00
# Device: XIAO Sense IMU
# Recording Duration: 00:02:30.5
# Total Samples: 3765
# Sample Rate: 25.1 Hz (average)
# Note: Header comments optional via --with-comment-header
millis,ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz,tempC,audioRMS
```

**CSV Format Compatibility**:

- Column order matches existing `print_stream` output exactly
- Decimal precision consistent with current implementation
- Line endings: LF only (Unix style)
- Comment header rows optional for tool compatibility

#### Recording Metadata File

Each recording generates a companion `.meta.json` file:

```json
{
  "session_id": "20240824_163000_001",
  "start_time": "2024-08-24T16:30:00+09:00",
  "end_time": "2024-08-24T16:32:30.5+09:00",
  "duration_seconds": 150.5,
  "total_samples": 3765,
  "average_sample_rate_hz": 25.1,
  "file_path": "recordings/2024-08-24/sensor_data_20240824_163000.csv",
  "file_size_bytes": 234567,
  "device_info": {
    "name": "XIAO Sense IMU",
    "connection_type": "BLE"
  },
  "recording_settings": {
    "buffer_size": 2000,
    "update_rate_fps": 15
  }
}
```

### Database Schema (Optional Enhancement)

For advanced session management, consider SQLite database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE recording_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP,
    duration_seconds REAL,
    total_samples INTEGER,
    sample_rate_hz REAL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size_bytes INTEGER,
    device_name TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Data Collection Protection (Highest Priority)

- **Minimal-impact monitoring**: Buffer monitoring uses short, infrequent locks
- **Dedicated worker thread**: Recording operations run in separate, low-priority thread
- **Separate thread priorities**: Data collection > UI > Recording
- **Error isolation**: Recording failures don't affect data collection

#### Memory Management

- **Streaming CSV writer**: No memory buildup during long recordings
- **Index-based tracking**: Efficiently track new data without large copies
- **Batch processing**: Process 100-row batches (≈4 seconds) to optimize I/O
- **Bounded write buffer**: Configurable memory limit for file operations

#### File I/O Optimization (Simplified)

- **Synchronous file operations**: Simple, reliable I/O with internal buffering
- **Buffered writes**: Batch writes every 100 rows to minimize disk operations
- **Timer-based polling**: 50Hz monitoring reduces CPU overhead
- **Efficient CSV formatting**: Pre-formatted strings to minimize processing

#### Concurrent Access Strategy (Revised)

```python
# Data Collection Thread (Never Blocked)
def collect_data():
    while collecting:
        sample = receive_ble_data()  # Real-time operation
        buffer.append(sample)  # Short lock only during append

# Recording Worker Thread (Background, Low Priority)
def record_data():
    while recording:
        # Short lock during buffer access only
        new_samples, next_index, dropped = buffer.get_since_index(last_index)

        if new_samples:
            file_writer.append_rows(new_samples)  # Sync I/O

        time.sleep(0.02)  # 50Hz polling - low CPU usage
```

#### Backpressure and Safety Mechanisms

- **Disk space monitoring**: Check available space before and during recording
- **Buffer overflow detection**: Warn when data is lost due to circular buffer limits
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue data collection even if recording fails
- **Automatic recovery**: Retry recording operations after transient failures
