## üöÄ Overview

A dual-component sensor data logging system for XIAO nRF52840 Sense microcontroller that collects IMU (accelerometer/gyroscope) and PDM microphone data, streaming it over BLE and USB Serial in CSV format.

### System Architecture

- **Sender**: C++/Arduino firmware running on XIAO nRF52840 Sense
- **Receiver**: Python BLE client tool for data collection and visualization

## üì¶ Components

### [Sender (Firmware)](./sender/)
- **Hardware**: XIAO nRF52840 Sense with LSM6DS3 IMU and PDM microphone
- **Framework**: Arduino + PlatformIO
- **Output**: CSV data via BLE Nordic UART Service and USB Serial
- **Data Rate**: ~100Hz via Serial, ~25Hz via BLE

### [Receiver (Python Tool)](./receiver/)
- **Platform**: Python 3.12+ with uv package manager
- **Features**: BLE data reception, CSV export, real-time visualization
- **Dependencies**: bleak (BLE), dash (web UI), plotly (charts)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: XIAO nRF52840 Sense board
- **Software**: 
  - PlatformIO Core (firmware development)
  - Python 3.12+ with uv (data reception)
  - Bluetooth adapter (for BLE reception)

### 1. Firmware Setup

```bash
cd sender/
pio run                    # Build firmware
pio run -t upload         # Upload (requires DFU mode - double-click reset)
pio device monitor -b 115200  # Monitor serial output
```

### 2. Data Reception

```bash
cd receiver/
uv sync                   # Install dependencies
uv run xiao-nrf52840-sense-receiver --no-header --drop-missing-audio
```

## üìä Data Format

CSV output with 9 fields:
```
millis,ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz,tempC,audioRMS
```

- **millis**: Timestamp (milliseconds since boot)
- **ax,ay,az**: Accelerometer (g)
- **gx,gy,gz**: Gyroscope (dps)  
- **tempC**: Temperature (¬∞C)
- **audioRMS**: Audio RMS value (10ms window, -1.0 for missing data)
